Nexthammer - a corpus frontend
================================

This is a project in it's very early stages. The goal is to replace the
jquery-based frontend available at
[https://github.com/hrmJ/nexthammer](https://github.com/hrmJ/nexthammer) with
a one based on react and redux. This interface will be connected to
a Lumen-based (php) api for the backend.
